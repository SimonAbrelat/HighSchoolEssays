	abstract = {This paper is a further discussion of the author's previous reports on the crimes committed by the Asahara-Aum Cult. First, the motivations of Asahara-Aum crimes, in particular those of murders, and their abnormality beyond the realm of criminology are ascertained. Second, psychopathology of the leader, Asahara, was considered, and it was assumed that Asahara was affected with the syndrome of pseudologia phantastica which was confirmed by his strange attitude during his trials. Third, the mental status of Asahara after the first trial was investigated, and some evidence was found that his mental status was so severe as to be 'unfit to plead' that psychiatric evaluation and treatment would be necessary. Fourth, the reasons for making people, in particular scientific elites, fascinated with Asahara and the Aum Cult were scrutinized and some clues were described. Finally, the problem that Aum has survived under the name of Aleph, how heavy capital punishment for Leader Asahara is appropriate, and that reparations for victims of Asahara-Aum crimes are urgent from the standpoint of social psychiatry, are discussed.},

	shorttitle = {Japanese {Visual} {Culture}},
	abstract = {Born of Japan's cultural encounter with Western entertainment media, manga (comic books or graphic novels) and anime (animated films) are two of the most universally recognized forms of contemporary mass culture. Because they tell stories through visual imagery, they vault over language barriers. Well suited to electronic transmission and distributed by Japan's globalized culture industry, they have become a powerful force in both the mediascape and the marketplace. This volume brings together an international group of scholars from many specialties to probe the richness and subtleties of these deceptively simple cultural forms. The contributors explore the historical, cultural, sociological, and religious dimensions of manga and anime, and examine specific sub-genres, artists, and stylistics. The book also addresses such topics as spirituality, the use of visual culture by Japanese new religious movements, Japanese Goth, nostalgia and Japanese pop, comics for girls, and more. With illustrations throughout, it is a rich source for all scholars and fans of manga and anime as well as students of contemporary mass culture or Japanese culture and civilization.},
